# UCI HAR Dataset - Feature Extraction and Modeling Project

This project explores human activity recognition using the UCI HAR dataset in **three structured stages**:

---

## ðŸ”¹ Stage 1: Custom Feature Engineering
- Extracted 99 statistical features from raw inertial signals.
- Trained and evaluated 12 classification models.

## ðŸ”¹ Stage 2: Preprocessed Dataset Modeling
- Used the UCI-provided preprocessed dataset (561 features).
- Trained and compared the same 12 models as Stage 1.

## ðŸ”¹ Stage 3: Feature Selection and Enhanced Modeling
- Applied various feature selection techniques on both 99 and 561 feature datasets.
- Trained models using selected top 20, 40, 60 , K VALUE OBTAINED USING KNEELOCATOR 'kneed library' features.
- Visualized and compared results.

Each folder contains its own `README.md` and output files in an `OUTPUT_PPD` subfolder.
